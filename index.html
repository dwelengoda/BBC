<p>A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing.</p>

<p>The findings were made by Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which is part of the US Department of Energy.</p>

<p>Scientists say the material could potentially reduce lithium use by up to 70%.</p>

<p>Since its discovery, the new material has been used to power a lightbulb.</p>

<p>Microsoft researchers used AI and supercomputers to narrow down 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than a week - a screening process that could have taken more than two decades to carry out using traditional lab research methods.</p>

<p>The process from inception to the development of a working battery prototype took less than nine months.</p>

<p>The two organizations achieved this by using advanced AI and high-performance computing which combines large numbers of computers to solve complex scientific and mathematical tasks.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Executive vice president of Microsoft, Jason Zander, told the BBC one of the tech giant's missions was to "compress 250 years of scientific discovery into the next 25".</p>
    <p>"And we think technology like this will help us do that. This is the way that this type of science I think is going to get done in the future," he said.</p>
